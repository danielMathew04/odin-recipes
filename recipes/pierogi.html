    <p> 
        Pierogi, cherished in Polish and Eastern European cuisine, are delectable dumplings bursting with flavor and tradition. 
        These pockets of dough are typically filled with a variety of savory ingredients, such as mashed potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, 
        or ground meat, and often accompanied by a generous dollop of sour cream or fried onions. Whether boiled, baked, or pan-fried 
        to golden perfection, pierogi offer a delightful blend of textures — the soft, pillowy dough enveloping a savory filling that 
        tantalizes the taste buds with each bite. Adored for their versatility and comforting appeal, pierogi hold a special place in 
        the hearts and homes of those who appreciate the simple joys of homemade comfort food.

    <h2> Steps: </h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until 
                translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. Season with
                 salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li>
            <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until 
                translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and 
                salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together. </li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit
                 cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round. </li>
            <li>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with 
                sauerkraut filling.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until 
            they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. </li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
